There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are [__track1__] tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is [__track2__] on the side track. You have two (and only two) options:

Do nothing, in which case the trolley will kill the  [__track1__] on the main track.
Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill [__track2__].
Which is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do?
